\section{Conclusion}

We propose \sysname, a framework that co-designs sketches and INT to measure large and small flows respectively for accurate and resource-efficient network measurement. To enable such a co-design, 
\sysname solves the NP-hard measurement point selection with the near-optimal Lagrangian relaxation. It offers congestion-free data collection with worst-case rate estimations of sending measurement data and RL-based dynamic path selection. We implement
\sysname on 64$\times$400\,Gbps Tofino switches. Our testbed experiments indicate that \sysname offers remarkable accuracy improvement (e.g., 5.1$\times$ higher F1 scores) while achieving low resource consumption.
